# SCRIMP2
This is the code for implementing the SCRIMP2 algorithm :`SCRIMP: Scalable Communication for Reinforcement- and Imitation-Learning-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding 2`

Contains updates by Jian Xiong

## Requirements

Python == 3.7
   ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    // pip install --force-reinstall torch==1.12.1+cu113 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/
   ```
    

## Setting up Code

* cd into the od_mstar3 folder.
* python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace.
* Check by going back to the root of the git folder, running python3 and `import od_mstar3.cpp_mstar`.
    
## Running Code

* Modify the parameters in `alg_parameters.py` to set the desired training setting and recording methods.
* Call python `driver.py`.
